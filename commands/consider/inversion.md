description: Solve backwards - what guarantees failure?
argument-hint: [goal or leave blank for current context]

<objective>
Apply inversion thinking to $ARGUMENTS (or the current discussion if no arguments provided).

Instead of asking "how do I succeed?", ask "what would guarantee failure?" Then avoid those things.
</objective>

<process>
1. State the goal or desired outcome
2. Ask: "What would guarantee we fail at this?"
3. List all paths to failure (be comprehensive)
4. Invert each failure mode into success criteria
5. Prioritize by which failure modes are most likely or most catastrophic
</process>

<output_format>
**Goal:** [What we're trying to achieve]

**Guaranteed Failures:**
- Failure 1: [what would cause it, how likely]
- Failure 2: [what would cause it, how likely]
- Failure 3: [what would cause it, how likely]

**Inverted Success Criteria:**
- To avoid failure 1, we must: [specific action]
- To avoid failure 2, we must: [specific action]
- To avoid failure 3, we must: [specific action]

**Key Insight:**
The most dangerous failure mode is... because...
</output_format>

<success_criteria>
- Identifies non-obvious failure modes
- Reveals hidden risks and assumptions
- Produces concrete avoidance strategies
- Highlights the most critical risks to mitigate
