description: Drill to root cause by asking why repeatedly
argument-hint: [problem or leave blank for current context]
---

<objective>
Apply the 5 Whys technique to $ARGUMENTS (or the current discussion if no arguments provided).

Drill past symptoms to find root causes by repeatedly asking "why" until you reach a fundamental cause that can be addressed.
</objective>

<process>
1. State the problem or symptom clearly
2. Ask "Why does this happen?" - Answer honestly
3. Take that answer, ask "Why?" again
4. Continue until you reach a root cause (typically 5 iterations, sometimes fewer)
5. Identify actionable interventions at the root level
</process>

<output_format>
**Problem:** [Initial symptom or issue]

**Why Chain:**
1. Why? → [First answer]
2. Why? → [Second answer]
3. Why? → [Third answer]
4. Why? → [Fourth answer]
5. Why? → [Root cause]

**Root Cause:** [Summary of fundamental issue]

**Intervention:** [What to do at the root level to prevent recurrence]
</output_format>

<success_criteria>
- Goes beyond surface symptoms
- Each "why" is answered honestly, not defensively
- Reaches a cause that's actually addressable
- Intervention prevents recurrence, not just current instance
</success_criteria>
