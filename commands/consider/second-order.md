<objective>
Apply second-order thinking to $ARGUMENTS (or the current discussion if no arguments provided).

Don't just consider immediate effects - trace the chain of consequences to anticipate what happens next, and what happens after that.
</objective>

<process>
1. State the decision or action being considered
2. Identify first-order effects (immediate, obvious consequences)
3. For each first-order effect, ask "And then what?"
4. Identify second-order effects (consequences of consequences)
5. Continue to third-order if relevant
6. Evaluate the full chain, not just immediate impact
</process>

<output_format>
**Decision/Action:** [What's being considered]

**First-Order Effects:** (Immediate)
- Effect 1: [obvious consequence]
- Effect 2: [obvious consequence]

**Second-Order Effects:** (And then what?)
- From effect 1 → [what happens next]
- From effect 2 → [what happens next]

**Third-Order Effects:** (If significant)
- [Downstream consequences]

**Net Assessment:**
When accounting for the full chain of effects, this decision...
</output_format>

<success_criteria>
- Goes beyond immediate, obvious effects
- Identifies unintended consequences
- Considers who else is affected downstream
- Reveals hidden costs or benefits that emerge over time
</success_criteria>
